# Simple Flask Social Network

## Install Flask!

Run the following command to install Flask!
```
pip install Flask
```

## Use Debug Mode
Turn on debug mode so that the server reloads whenever you make changes

```
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

## Run the app!

Now you're ready to run the app.
```
FLASK_APP=application.py flask run
```

This should give you some output, including something like the following:

```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
```

Go to the url in the browser and behold!
